      <description>We’re proud to announce that our PhD candidate Raffaele Sommese has won the Best Paper Award at TMA 2021 for his paper entitled “Characterization of Anycast Adoption in the DNS Authoritative Infrastructure”.
The paper, co-authored with colleagues from UC San Diego, SIDN Labs and CAIDA, studies the evolving adoption of anycast by authoritative name servers in the DNS. As a core infrastructure, the continuous availability of the DNS is of critical importance, and the adoption of anycast can help improve the availability of the DNS.</description>

      <description>Our work on orphan records: &amp;ldquo;The forgotten side of DNS: orphan and abandoned records&amp;rdquo; presented at WTMC2020 and at OARC33 raised a lot of interest in the DNS community. Afilias, which owns some of the TLDs affected by the orphan misconfiguration acknowledge the problem and is working on to fixing it .

      <description>Our work on delegation inconsistency: &amp;ldquo;When parents and children disagree: Diving into DNS delegation inconsistency&amp;rdquo; presented at PAM2020 and at RIPE80 raised a lot of interest in the DNS community. There is a new Internet draft on the DNSOP WG that addresses this inconsistency issue: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-huque-dnsop-ns-revalidation As requested by one of the draft’s authors, we provide here a similar setup as used in our paper, so developers can test their resolvers.</description>

      <description>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are one of the most disruptive attacks in today&amp;rsquo;s Internet. These types of attacks are even more effective and more dangerous when they involve and misuse Internet infrastructure and services.
One of the targets of these attacks is the Domain Name System (DNS). The DNS is a fundamental pillar of the Internet&amp;rsquo;s core infrastructure, and its role is crucial not only for the translation of human-readable names into IP addresses but also for supporting plenty of widely used Internet applications, such as e-mail, VoIP, etc.</description>

      <description>The MADDVIPR project has been actively working to share their research findings with the DNS community to improve the overall resilience of the DNS ecosystem. Here, we provide a comprehensive list of presentations and blog posts detailing the results of our research efforts aimed at improving the overall resiliency of the DNS ecosystem. Our outreach efforts have been targeted towards academic, technical, and governmental environments, and we are proud to share the insights and knowledge gained from our project with the wider community.</description>

      <description>When Parents and Children Disagree: Diving into DNS Delegation Inconsistency Raffaele Sommese, Giovane Moura, Mattijs Jonker, Roland van Rijswijk-Deij, Alberto Dainotti, Kimberly Claffy, Anna Sperotto PAM2020 Passive and Active Measurement Conference The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical, decentralized, and distributed database. A key mechanism that enables the DNS to be hierarchical and distributed is delegation [7] of responsibility from parent to child zones—typically managed by different entities. RFC1034 [12] states that authoritative nameserver (NS) records at both parent and child should be “consistent and remain so”, but we find inconsistencies for over 13M second-level domains.</description>

      <description>Ir. Raffaele Sommese  (Ph.D. candidate, University of Twente) Raffaele is currently a PhD student in his fourth year at the University of Twente, where his research is centered around DNS resiliency. This involves studying and identifying DDoS attacks targeted towards DNS, analyzing DNS vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, and developing effective strategies to mitigate and prevent such attacks.
Dr. Anna Sperotto (Associate Professor, University of Twente) Anna is associate professor in the area of Network Security at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science at the University of Twente.</description>
