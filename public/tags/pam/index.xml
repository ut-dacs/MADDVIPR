      <description>Our work on delegation inconsistency: &amp;ldquo;When parents and children disagree: Diving into DNS delegation inconsistency&amp;rdquo; presented at PAM2020 and at RIPE80 raised a lot of interest in the DNS community. There is a new Internet draft on the DNSOP WG that addresses this inconsistency issue: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-huque-dnsop-ns-revalidation As requested by one of the draftâ€™s authors, we provide here a similar setup as used in our paper, so developers can test their resolvers.</description>
