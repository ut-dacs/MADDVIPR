Our work on delegation inconsistency: "When parents and children disagree:
Diving into DNS delegation inconsistency" presented at PAM2020 and at RIPE80
raised a lot of interest in the DNS community.
There is a new Internet draft on the DNSOP WG that addresses this inconsistency issue:
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-huque-dnsop-ns-revalidation">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-huque-dnsop-ns-revalidation</a>
As requested by one of the draftâ€™s authors, we provide here a similar setup as used in our paper, 
so developers can test their resolvers.
Check our SuperDNS.nl tool <a href="https://superdns.nl">here</a>
and test your resolvers.
