## Raffaele Sommese
### (Ph.D. candidate, University of Twente)

Raffaele Sommese is a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Twente.
He received his M.Sc. (cum laude) in Computer Engineering from Politecnico di Torino in 2018, with a thesis titled "Boosting the performance of NFV services with SmartNIC" and his B.Sc. (cum laude) in Computer Engineering from University of Naples Federico II, with a thesis titled "An SDN-based setup for active measurements in mobile networks".
His research interests focus on DNS DDoS Security, programmable high-speed dataplanes, SmartNIC technologies, and network measurements.
The goal of his Ph.D. research is to analyze and characterize the DNS vulnerabilities and misconfiguration in order to improve the protection and the prevention against DNS DDoS attack.

## DR. Anna Sperotto
### (Associate Professor, University of Twente)

Dr. Sperotto is assistant professor in the area of Network Security at the DACS Group. She received a Ph.D. degree from the same university in 2010, with a thesis titled “Flow-based Intrusion Detection”. She holds an M.Sc. degree (cum laude) and B.Sc. degree (cum laude) from the Ca’ Foscari University, Venice, Italy. Her research interests focus on Network Security, with a measurement approach.
