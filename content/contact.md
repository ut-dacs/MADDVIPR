## Ir. Raffaele Sommese
### (Ph.D. candidate, University of Twente)

Raffaele is currently a PhD student in his fourth year at the University of Twente, where his research is centered around DNS resiliency. This involves studying and identifying DDoS attacks targeted towards DNS, analyzing DNS vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, and developing effective strategies to mitigate and prevent such attacks.

## Dr. Anna Sperotto
### (Associate Professor, University of Twente)

Anna is assistant professor in the area of Network Security  at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science at the University of Twente. She received a Ph.D. degree from the same university in 2010, with a thesis titled “Flow-based Intrusion Detection”. She holds an M.Sc. degree (cum laude) and B.Sc. degree (cum laude) from the Ca’ Foscari University, Venice, Italy. Her research interests focus on Network Security, with a measurement approach. She is involved with the IRTF Network Management Research Group (NMRG). Papers she has co-authored have been awarded the IRTF Applied Networking Research Prize in 2013, 2015 and 2017. She was a visiting researcher at the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), University of California, San Diego, USA.

## Prof. ir. Roland Van Rijswijk-Deij
#### (Adjunct Professor, University of Twente)

Roland is an adjunct professor in the Design and Analysis of Communication Systems group at the University of Twente's Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science. He has a background in embedded systems, applied cryptography, and networking, and has worked for various organizations in the past, including British Telecom, Royal Philips Electronics, AET Europe, InTraffic, and SURFnet. Roland has initiated several innovation projects in the past that have focused on different areas such as DNS, DNSSEC, DDoS attack detection and mitigation, and IPv6. He is the founder of the OpenINTEL project and was responsible for designing and implementing its measurement architecture. Roland continues to expand the project's measurement capabilities to create new opportunities for DNS research.

## Dr. ir. Mattijs Jonker
#### (Assistant Professor, University of Twente)

Mattijs is assistant professor at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science at the University of Twente. He specializes in network security and uses Internet measurement and data science techniques in his research. He has a PhD in Computer Science and a master's degree in Cyber Security. Mattijs is the lead data architect for the OpenINTEL project and has played a significant role in driving innovation in data sharing and processing. His efforts have resulted in the creation of new research and teaching opportunities that utilize the project, both within the university and through international and multidisciplinary collaborations. Mattijs is dedicated to making the project's data accessible to the research and operator communities by reducing any barriers to its independent use.

## Prof. Dr. KC Claffy
#### (Director, Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA))
KC is director of the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), which
she founded at the UC San Diego Supercomputer Center in 1996. CAIDA provides Internet
measurement tools, data, analyses and research to promote a robust, scalable global Internet
infrastructure. As a research scientist at SDSC and Adjunct Professor of Computer Science
& Engineering at UCSD, her research interests include Internet (workload, performance,
topology, routing, and economics) data collection, analysis, visualization, and enabling others
to make use of CAIDA data and results. She has been at SDSC since 1991 and holds a Ph.D.
in Computer Science from UC San Diego. 

## Dr. Alberto Dainotti
#### (Associate Professor, Georgia Tech)
Alberto is an Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science at the College of Computing at Georgia Tech,
where he leads the Internet Intelligence Lab. His research focuses on the intersection of Internet measurement,
data science, and cybersecurity. Alberto's primary interest is understanding when and how Internet infrastructure
can fail and finding solutions to these issues. To achieve this, he develops methods and builds near-real-time
streaming data analytics systems (IODA, BGPStream, GRIP) that use diverse data sources to monitor and improve
the security and reliability of Internet infrastructure. 
Before joining Georgia Tech, Alberto worked as an Associate Research Scientist and Principal Investigator at 
CAIDA, University of California San Diego.
He received his Ph.D. in Computer Engineering and Systems from the University of Napoli "Federico II", Italy, in 2008.
