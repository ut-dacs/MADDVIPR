    <p>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are one of the most disruptive attacks in today&rsquo;s Internet.
These types of attacks are even more effective and more dangerous when they involve and misuse Internet infrastructure and services.</p>

<p>One of the targets of these attacks is the Domain Name System (DNS).
The DNS is a fundamental pillar of the Internet&rsquo;s core infrastructure, and its role is crucial not only for the translation of human-readable names into IP addresses but also for supporting plenty of widely used Internet applications, such as e-mail, VoIP, etc.</p>

<p>This is the reason why DDoS attacks on DNS infrastructure will have a devastating effect, indeed an attack able to disrupt the DNS infrastructure can disrupt the entire Internet itself.</p>

<p>MADDVIPR (Mapping DNS DDoS Vulnerabilities to Improve Protection and Prevention) project is a collaboration between the University of Twente and the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA-UCSD)</p>

<p>This project will lead the following results:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identification of the impact of possible attacks by providing a complete and comprehensive view of the potential damage and analysing the current state of the art.</li>
<li>Combine historical data from OpenINTEL with the knowledge developed in the first point to identify possible weak points and vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Study and prioritise the risks by creating a ranking of DNS vulnerabilities to inform operators and security experts in order to increase their resilience to future attacks.</li>
</ul>
