<h2 id="dr-alberto-dainotti">Dr. Alberto Dainotti</h2>

<h4 id="associate-professor-georgia-tech">(Associate Professor, Georgia Tech)</h4>

<p>Alberto is an Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science at the College of Computing at Georgia Tech,
where he leads the Internet Intelligence Lab. His research focuses on the intersection of Internet measurement,
data science, and cybersecurity. Alberto&rsquo;s primary interest is understanding when and how Internet infrastructure
can fail and finding solutions to these issues. To achieve this, he develops methods and builds near-real-time
streaming data analytics systems (IODA, BGPStream, GRIP) that use diverse data sources to monitor and improve
the security and reliability of Internet infrastructure.
Before joining Georgia Tech, Alberto worked as an Associate Research Scientist and Principal Investigator at
CAIDA, University of California San Diego.
He received his Ph.D. in Computer Engineering and Systems from the University of Napoli &ldquo;Federico II&rdquo;, Italy, in 2008.</p>
